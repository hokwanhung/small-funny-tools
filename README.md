## Installation

The installation of different programs are vastly different, and cannot be mentioned as one in the `Installation` section. 

However, many of it contains environment specification documents, such as `requirements.txt` or `package.json`. Some programs are also packed into `.exe` for better execution.

## Usage

### NestedLoopPattern

Prints a couple of shapes by simply manipulating different loops.

`java` `school`

### findPrimeFactor

Extract all factors from the smallest to the largest. And as the square of target must be below the `detectInput`, the upper limit is set to the square of `detectInput`.

`java` `school`

### gameofLife

Displays a small game of life program by using `0` and `1`. The code simulates the game for one generation only, but iterations can be done through calling the`nextGeneration` function, and the `M` and `N` values, which represents the no. of rows and columns, can also be changed to represent different size of grids.

`java` `school`

### printOutDiamondWithoutLimitations

Prints out Diamond shapes according to the user's input. Tiny little program, but brings much joy when I started.

`java` `school`
