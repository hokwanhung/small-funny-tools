# small-funny-tools

The repository, `small-funny-tools`, contains many tiny-size programs that performs various functions (many for just improving daily life with automation). The aspects of different (but small) programs are classified as below (shown as tags):

- `components`:  compacted methods or components that can work well in some conditions.
- `daily`: structured programs that can handle certain aspects of daily routine.
- `others`: structured programs that can handle some aspects of certain tasks.
- `school`: methods/programs that are done as a part of the school work.

## Installation

The installation of different programs are vastly different, and cannot be mentioned as one in the `Installation` section. 

However, many of it contains environment specification documents, such as `requirements.txt` or `package.json`. Some programs are also packed into `.exe` for better execution.

## Usage

### components

#### detectInputType

Detect whether the `Integer` is positive, zero or negative.

`java` `component`

#### htmlConverter

Ammend `html` elements tags to the target `String`.

`java` `component`

### daily

### others

### school

#### DiamondsWith3Loops

Print out `Diamond` shapes with `no. of lines` to input, but are forced to print any in only 3 loops.

`java` `school`

#### FindPrime

Extract all factors from the smallest to the largest. And as the square of target must be below the `detectInput`, the upper limit is set to the square of `detectInput`. Another version of different code forms are included as well.

`java` `school`

#### NestedLoopPattern

Print a couple of shapes by simply manipulating different loops.

`java` `school`

#### FarmerWolfGoatCabbageProblem

Play the classic Farmer, Wolf, Goad and Cabbage problem with AI to auto-solve the problem.

`python` `school`

#### gameofLife

Display a small game of life program by using `0` and `1`. The code simulates the game for one generation only, but iterations can be done through calling the`nextGeneration` function, and the `M` and `N` values, which represents the no. of rows and columns, can also be changed to represent different size of grids.

`java` `school`

#### printOutDiamondWithoutLimitations

Print out Diamond shapes according to the user's input. Tiny little program, but brings much joy when I started.

Note: The program is incomplete as I only capture the core part of the program.

`java` `school`
